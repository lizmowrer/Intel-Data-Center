## 📊 Overview

This project analyzes U.S. regional energy production and renewable energy trends to inform Intel’s decision on where to build its next data center.  
The goal was to evaluate energy availability, renewable energy adoption, and power plant distribution across regions to provide data-driven recommendations for site selection.

## 🧠 Key Objectives

- Identify regions that are net energy producers  
- Analyze total and renewable energy generation by region  
- Assess energy production trends by hour and energy type  
- Aggregate power plant data to evaluate renewable and solar photovoltaic capacity  
- Provide strategic recommendations for Intel’s data center location

## 🔍 Key Findings

### 1️⃣ Energy Production Trends
- The Mid-Atlantic region has the highest net positive energy production at 31,693,087 units.  
- The Northwest and Texas lead in total renewable energy production, while California ranks high in renewable energy percentage.

### 2️⃣ Power Plant Analysis
- The Midwest has the most renewable power plants (234), but its average energy production per plant is lower than comparable regions.  
- Solar photovoltaic capacity is concentrated in regions with at least 50 plants, with efficiency varying by region.

### 3️⃣ Hourly Renewable Energy Trends
- The Northwest consistently produces 7–9 million units of renewable energy per hour, outperforming California’s 2–5 million units.  
- Peak renewable generation occurs around hour 18 in the Northwest and hour 14 in California.

## 🧾 Recommendation

I recommend the **Northwest region** for Intel’s next data center due to its strong combination of affordability and sustainability:  

- Second-highest net positive production at 21,685,235 units  
- Leads in renewable energy generation with 52.25% of energy from renewables  
- Consistently produces 2–3 million units of renewable energy per week, ensuring a stable and sustainable energy supply  
- **Washington state** stands out within the region, generating 74,496,509 units of renewable energy, far surpassing fossil fuel generation
