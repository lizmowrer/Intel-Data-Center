## Recommendation

I recommend the **Northwest region** for the next data center due to its strong combination of affordability and sustainability. The Northwest has the second-highest net positive energy production at **21,685,235 units** and leads the regions in renewable energy generation, with **52.25% of its energy coming from renewable sources**. This region also consistently generates 2â€“3 million units of renewable energy each week, ensuring a stable and sustainable energy supply.  

Within the Northwest, **Washington state** stands out, generating **74,496,509 units of renewable energy**, far surpassing its fossil fuel generation. This makes Washington an excellent choice for a data center, offering both cost-effective and sustainable energy options.
